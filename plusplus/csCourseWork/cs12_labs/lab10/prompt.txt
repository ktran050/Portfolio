● For this exercise you will be using recursion to manipulate a string.

● Your function should then reverse the contents of the string using recursion.

● Your function may not use for loops, while loops, do while loops or any other iterative 

approach.

● The goal here is to implement a function that will have one string parameter that is to be 

passed by reference.

● The function definition should be named as follows: void reverse(string &s);

● Your file should be named main.cpp.

● It is important that you build a test harness to ensure your code is functioning correctly.

● DO NOT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES.
